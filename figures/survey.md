# A Survey on Model Light-Weighting Research

## Introduction
Transformer based models such as PGT-Series, Llama series and Baichuan series have fully proved their effectiveness, but they still have significant problems, such as slow model training/inferenc speed, limited reasoning length, and too large model scale. In this context, Model Light-Weighting (MLW) is an umbrella term for a series of methods proposed along the lines of large model training/inference speed up, slimming, etc., spanning the entire model lifecycle.
